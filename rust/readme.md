The goal of this project is to get a system working to interface any type of toy connected to a rasberry pi with buttplug.io  
It could also be used in a more general sense with some modification.  
It will start off communicating with bluetooth, but may branch out later.


these are required for bluetooth to work:
sudo apt install libdbus-1-dev libdbus-1-3
